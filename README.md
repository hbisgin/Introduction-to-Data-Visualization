# Introduction-to-Data-Visualization
This repo has the materials Dr. Halil Bisgin created for the Introduction to Data Visualization Course by using multiple books. Course syllabus lists all these books. There are also images used from internet sources to give examples for bad visualization and deception purposes. Skipped slide numbers indicate that either slides are not followed for those lectures or some slides cover two lectures. 

You're welcome to use these materials. It would be always nice to give credit when you present them. 

Thank you for your interest.
